# addition, subtraction, multiplication, & division operators
number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0

# modulo (%) operator returns the integer remainder of the division
remainder = 11 % 3

# two multiplication symbols make a power relationship
squared = 7 ** 2
cubed = 2 ** 3

# concatenate strings using the addition operator
helloworld = 'hello' + 'world'

# multiply strings to form a string with a repeating sequence
lotsofhellos = 'hello' * 10

# lists can be joined using addition operators
even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
odd_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]
all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers

# form new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator
repeat = [1, 2, 3] * 3
