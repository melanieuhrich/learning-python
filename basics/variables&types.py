# python is object-oriented --
    # -- you do not need to declare variables or their type before using them
    # -- every variable in python is an object

# defining an integer
myint = 7

# defining a floating point number
myfloat = 7.0
# OR
myfloat = float(7)

# strings
mystring = 'hello'
# OR
mystring = "hello"

# assigning several variables simultaneously 
a, b = 3, 4
